# This is the CMakeCache file.
# For build in directory: /Users/tgg/Github/rdkit/CMakeFiles/CMakeTmp
# It was generated by CMake: /usr/local/Cellar/cmake/3.16.2/bin/cmake
# You can edit this file to change values found and used by cmake.
# If you do not want to change any of the values, simply exit the editor.
# If you do want to change a value, simply edit, save, and exit the editor.
# The syntax for the file is as follows:
# KEY:TYPE=VALUE
# KEY is the name of a variable in the cache.
# TYPE is a hint to GUIs for the type of VALUE, DO NOT EDIT TYPE!.
# VALUE is the current value for the KEY.
