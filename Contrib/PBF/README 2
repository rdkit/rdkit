- PBFRDKit.cpp includes an implementation of the PBF method.
- demo.cpp includes an example of using the method and also tests,
  using data from the testData directory, that results are correct.
- testData/egfr.sdf is sample data taken from DUD
- testData/egfr.out is reference output data

Usage requires a local installation of Eigen (http://eigen.tuxfamily.org/),
which is used internally to solve the eigenvalue problem.
