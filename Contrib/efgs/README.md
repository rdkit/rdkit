Source code of EFGs, a complete an accurate implementation of Ertl's functional group (FG) detection algorithm.

For a RDKit molecule, it provides four outputs: 
a) a PNG binary string with an image of the molecule with color-highlighted
functional groups; 
b) a list of sets of atom indices (idx), each set corresponding to a
functional group; 
c) a list of pseudo-SMILES canonicalized strings for the full functional
groups; 
d) a list of RDKit labeled mol objects, one for each full functional group
