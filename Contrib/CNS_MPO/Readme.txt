Herein, I present 2 scripts which are able to calculate CNS MPO value, based on the inputed by the user SMILES and pKa value:

a) script "cns_mpo_csv_to_df" works on .csv file, that contains "Id", "SMILES" and "pKa" columns, respectively. Columns are obligatory separated by the semicolon (";"). Within this directory I have attached .csv file ("csv_file_with_example_molecules"), as an example of use.
b) script "cns_mpo_single_molecule" enables the user to calculate CNS MPO for a single (or multiple) molecule with SMILES and pKa values deposited in the python lists.

Some additional data, like requirements, example of use and authors, are deposited as comments within these scripts.
