# Description of data files in this folder

## Solubility dataset
- solubility.test.sdf (257 records)
- solubility.train.sdf (1025 records)

The two sdf files(hereby named "solubility dataset") are originated from the Huuskonen dataset. The Huuskonen dataset contains a training set of 884 compounds and a randomly chosen test set of 413 compounds.
