Installation
%%%%%%%%%%%%

Below a number of installation recipies is presented, with varying degree of
complexity.

Linux and the Mac
+++++++++++++++++

Installation from repositories
******************************

Ubuntu 12.04 and later
----------------------

Thanks to the efforts of the Debichem team, RDKit is available via the Ubuntu repositories.
To install::

    sudo apt-get install python-rdkit librdkit1 rdkit-data

Fedora, CentOS, and RHEL
------------------------

Gianluca Sforna creates binary RPMs that can be found here: <http://giallu.fedorapeople.org/rdkit-20XX.XX/>_

    
MacOS
-----

Eddie Cao has produced a homebrew formula that can be used to easily build the RDKit <https://github.com/rdkit/homebrew-rdkit>_


Building from Source
********************

Prerequisites
-------------

Installing prerequisites as packages
====================================

Ubuntu and other debian-derived systems
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Install the following packages using apt-get::

   flex bison build-essential python-numpy cmake python-dev sqlite3 libsqlite3-dev 
   libboost-dev libboost-python-dev libboost-regex-dev


Fedora, CentOS (5.7+), and RHEL
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Install the following packages using yum::

   cmake tk-devel readline-devel zlib-devel bzip2-devel sqlite-devel @development-tools

Packages to install from source (not required on RHEL/CentOS 6.x):

  * python 2.7 : use ./configure CFLAGS=-fPIC --enable-unicode=ucs4 --enable-shared
  * numpy : do export LD_LIBRARY_PATH="/usr/local/lib" before python setup.py install
  * boost 1.48.0 or later: do ./bootstrap.sh --with-libraries=python,regex; ./b2; ./b2 install

Older versions of CentOS
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Here things are more difficult. Check this wiki page for 
information: https://code.google.com/p/rdkit/wiki/BuildingOnCentOS

Installing prerequisites from source
====================================

 * Required packages:

   * cmake. You need version 2.6 (or more recent). http://www.cmake.org if your linux distribution doesn't have an appropriate package. 
     
     .. note:: It seems that v2.8 is a better bet than v2.6. It might be worth compiling your own copy of v2.8 even if v2.6 is already installed.
   
   * The following are required if you are planning on using the Python wrappers
   
      * The python headers. This probably means that you need to install the python-dev package (or whatever it's called) for your linux distribution.
      * sqlite3. You also need the shared libraries. This may require that you install a sqlite3-dev package.
      * You need to have numpy (http://www.scipy.org/NumPy) installed. 
      
        .. note:: for building with XCode4 on the MacOS â€“ there seems to be a problem with the version of numpy that comes with XCode4. Please see below in the (see :ref:`faq`) section for a workaround.
 * Optional packages
 
   * If you would like to install the RDKit InChI support (first available in the Q2 2011 release), follow the instructions in $RDBASE/External/INCHI-API to get a copy of the InChI source and put it in the appropriate place.

Installing Boost
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If your linux distribution has a boost-devel package including the python and regex libraries, you can use that and save yourself the steps below. 

.. note:: if you *do* have a version of the boost libraries pre-installed and you want to use your own version, be careful when you build the code. We've seen at least one example on a Fedora system where cmake compiled using a user-installed version of boost and then linked against the system version. This led to segmentation faults. There is a workaround for this below in the (see :ref:`FAQ`) section.

  * download the boost source distribution from `the boost web site <http://www.boost.org>`_
  * extract the source somewhere on your machine (e.g. ``/usr/local/src/boost_1_45_0``)
  * build the required boost libraries:
  
    * ``cd $BOOST``
    * If you want to use the python wrappers: ``./bootstrap.sh --with-libraries=python,regex``
    * If not using the python wrappers: ``./bootstrap.sh --with-libraries=regex``
    * Building on 32 bit systems: ``./b2 install``
    * Building on 64 bit systems: ``./b2 address-model=64 cflags=-fPIC cxxflags=-fPIC install``

    If you have any problems with this step, check the boost `installation instructions <http://www.boost.org/more/getting_started/unix-variants.html>`_.

Building the RDKit
------------------

Fetch the source, here as tar.gz but you could use git as well::

    wget http://downloads.sourceforge.net/project/rdkit/rdkit/QX_20XX/RDKit_20XX_XX_X.tgz

  * Ensure that the prerequisites are installed
  * environment variables:
  
    * RDBASE: the root directory of the RDKit distribution (e.g. ~/RDKit)
    * *Linux:* LD_LIBRARY_PATH: make sure it includes $RDBASE/lib and wherever the boost shared libraries were installed
    * *Mac:* DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH: make sure it includes $RDBASE/lib and wherever the boost shared libraries were installed
    * The following are required if you are planning on using the Python wrappers:
      * PYTHONPATH: make sure it includes $RDBASE
  * Building:
  
    * cd to $RDBASE
    * ``mkdir build``
    * ``cd build``
    * ``cmake ..`` : See the section below on configuring the build if you need to specify a non-default version of python or if you have boost in a non-standard location
    * ``make`` : this builds all libraries, regression tests, and wrappers (by default).
    * ``make install``

See below for a list of :ref:`FAQ` and solutions.

Testing the build (optional, but recommended)
---------------------------------------------

  * cd to $RDBASE/build and do ``ctest``
  * you're done!

Advanced
--------

Specifying an alternate Boost installation
==========================================

You need to tell cmake where to find the boost libraries and header files:

If you have put boost in /opt/local, the cmake invocation would look like::

    cmake -DBOOST_ROOT=/opt/local ..

Specifying an alternate Python installation
===========================================

You need to tell cmake where to find the python library it should link against and the python header files.

Here's a sample command line::

    cmake -D PYTHON_LIBRARY=/usr/lib/python2.5/config/libpython2.5.a -D PYTHON_INCLUDE_DIR=/usr/include/python2.5/ -D PYTHON_EXECUTABLE=/usr/bin/python ..

The ``PYTHON_EXECUTABLE`` part is optional if the correct python is the first version in your PATH.

Disabling the Python wrappers
=============================

You can completely disable building of the python wrappers by setting the configuration variable RDK_BUILD_PYTHON_WRAPPERS to nil::

    cmake -D RDK_BUILD_PYTHON_WRAPPERS= ..

Building the Java wrappers
==========================

*Additional Requirements*

* SWIG v2.0.x: http://www.swig.org
* Junit: get a copy of the junit .jar file from https://github.com/KentBeck/junit/downloads and put it in the directory ``$RDBASE/External/java_lib`` (you will need to create the directory) and rename it to junit.jar.

*Building*

  * When you invoke cmake add ``-D RDK_BUILD_SWIG_WRAPPERS=ON`` to the arguments. For example: ``cmake -D RDK_BUILD_SWIG_WRAPPERS=ON ..``

  * Build and install normally using `make`. The directory ``$RDBASE/Code/JavaWrappers/gmwrapper`` will contain the three required files: libGraphMolWrap.so (libGraphMolWrap.jnilib on the Mac), org.RDKit.jar, and org.RDKitDoc.jar.

*Using the wrappers*

To use the wrappers, the three files need to be in the same directory, and that should be on your CLASSPATH and in the java.library.path. An example using jython::

    % CLASSPATH=$CLASSPATH:$RDBASE/Code/JavaWrappers/gmwrapper/org.RDKit.jar; jython -Djava.library.path=$RDBASE/Code/JavaWrappers/gmwrapper
    Jython 2.2.1 on java1.6.0_20
    Type "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
    >>> from org.RDKit import *
    >>> from java import lang
    >>> lang.System.loadLibrary('GraphMolWrap')
    >>> m = RWMol.MolFromSmiles('c1ccccc1')
    >>> m.getNumAtoms()
    6L



.. _FAQ:

Frequently Encountered Problems
-------------------------------


In each case I've replaced specific pieces of the path with ``...``.

*Problem:* ::

    Linking CXX shared library libSLNParse.so
    /usr/bin/ld: .../libboost_regex.a(cpp_regex_traits.o): relocation R_X86_64_32S against `std::basic_string<char, std::char_traits<char>, std::allocator<char> >::_Rep::_S_empty_rep_storage' can not be used when making a shared object; recompile with -fPIC
    .../libboost_regex.a: could not read symbols: Bad value
    collect2: ld returned 1 exit status
    make[2]: *** [Code/GraphMol/SLNParse/libSLNParse.so] Error 1
    make[1]: *** [Code/GraphMol/SLNParse/CMakeFiles/SLNParse.dir/all] Error 2
    make: *** [all] Error 2


*Solution:*

Add this to the arguments when you call cmake: ``-DBoost_USE_STATIC_LIBS=OFF``

More information here: `<http://www.mail-archive.com/rdkit-discuss@lists.sourceforge.net/msg01119.html>`_

----

*Problem:* ::


     .../Code/GraphMol/Wrap/EditableMol.cpp:114:   instantiated from here
     .../boost/type_traits/detail/cv_traits_impl.hpp:37: internal compiler error: in make_rtl_for_nonlocal_decl, at cp/decl.c:5067
    Please submit a full bug report,
    with preprocessed source if appropriate.
    See <URL:http://bugzilla.redhat.com/bugzilla> for instructions.
    Preprocessed source stored into /tmp/ccgSaXge.out file, please attach this to your bugreport.
    make[2]: *** [Code/GraphMol/Wrap/CMakeFiles/rdchem.dir/EditableMol.cpp.o] Error 1
    make[1]: *** [Code/GraphMol/Wrap/CMakeFiles/rdchem.dir/all] Error 2
    make: *** [all] Error 2


*Solution:*

Add ``#define BOOST_PYTHON_NO_PY_SIGNATURES`` at the top of ``Code/GraphMol/Wrap/EditableMol.cpp``

More information here: `<http://www.mail-archive.com/rdkit-discuss@lists.sourceforge.net/msg01178.html>`_


----

*Problem:*

Your system has a version of boost installed in /usr/lib, but you would like to force the RDKit to use a more recent one.

*Solution:*

This can be solved by using cmake version 2.8.3 (or more recent) and providing the ``-D Boost_NO_SYSTEM_PATHS=ON`` argument::

    cmake -D BOOST_ROOT=/usr/local -D Boost_NO_SYSTEM_PATHS=ON ..


----

*Problem:*

Building on the Mac with XCode 4

The problem seems to be caused by the version of numpy that is distributed with XCode 4, so you need to build a fresh copy.


*Solution:*
Get a copy of numpy and build it like this as root:
as root::

    export MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET=10.6
    export LDFLAGS="-Wall -undefined dynamic_lookup -bundle -arch x86_64"
    export CFLAGS="-arch x86_64"
    ln -s /usr/bin/gcc /usr/bin/gcc-4.2
    ln -s /usr/bin/g++ /usr/bin/g++-4.2
    python setup.py build
    python setup.py install


Be sure that the new numpy is used in the build::

    PYTHON_NUMPY_INCLUDE_PATH        /Library/Python/2.6/site-packages/numpy/core/include

and is at the beginning of the PYTHONPATH::

    export PYTHONPATH="/Library/Python/2.6/site-packages:$PYTHONPATH"

Now it's safe to build boost and the RDKit.

Windows
+++++++

Prerequisites
*************

  * Python 2.7 (from http://www.python.org/)
  * numpy (from http://numpy.scipy.org/ or use ``pip install numpy``). Binaries for win64 are available here: http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#numpy
  * PIL: (from http://www.pythonware.com/products/pil/index.htm or use ``pip install PIL``)

Recommended extras
------------------

  * aggdraw: a library for high-quality drawing in Python. Instructions for downloading are here: http://effbot.org/zone/aggdraw-index.htm The new (as of May 2008) drawing code has been tested with v1.2a3 of aggdraw. Despite the alpha label, the code is stable and functional.
  * matplotlib: a library for scientific plotting from Python. http://matplotlib.sourceforge.net/
  * ipython : a very useful interactive shell (and much more) for Python. http://ipython.scipy.org/dist/
  * win32all: Windows extensions for Python. http://sourceforge.net/projects/pywin32/

Installation of RDKit binaries
******************************

  * Get the appropriate windows binary build from: <https://sourceforge.net/projects/rdkit/files/rdkit/>_
  * Extract the zip file somewhere without a space in the name, i.e. ``c:/``
  * The rest of this will assume that the installation is in ``c:/RDKit_2012_12_1``
  * Set the following environment variables:
    * RDBASE: ``c:/RDKit_2012_12_1`` 
    * PYTHONPATH: ``%RDBASE%`` if there is already a PYTHONPATH, put ``;%RDBASE%`` at the end.
    * PATH: add ``;%RDBASE%/lib`` to the end

In Win7 systems, you may run into trouble due to missing DLLs, see one thread from the mailing list: 
http://www.mail-archive.com/rdkit-discuss@lists.sourceforge.net/msg01632.html
You can download the missing DLLs from here: http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=5555

Installation from source
************************

Extra software to install
-------------------------

  * Microsoft Visual C++ : The Express version has everything
    necessary and can be downloaded for free
    (http://www.microsoft.com/express/download/). This
    is a big installation and will take a while. The RDKit has been
    successfully built with all version of visual c++ since 6.0, so
    the current version of VC++ (2010 as of this writing) should be
    fine.
  * cmake : (http://www.cmake.org/cmake/resources/software.html) should be installed.
  * boost : It is strongly recommended to download and use a
    precompiled version of the boost libraries from
    http://sourceforge.net/projects/boost/files/boost-binaries/ . When you run the installer,
    the only binary libraries you need are python, regex, and system.
    If you want to install boost from source, download a copy from
    http://www.boost.org and follow the instructions
    in the "Getting Started" section of the documentation. Make sure
    the libraries and headers are installed to c:\boost
  * a git client : *This is only necessary if you are planning
    on building development versions of the RDKit.* This can be downloaded from
    http://git-scm.com/downloads .
  * Optional packages

    * If you would like to install the RDKit InChI support, follow the
      instructions in $RDBASE/External/INCHI-API/README to get a copy
      of the InChI source and put it in the appropriate place.

    * If you would like to install the RDKit Avalon toolkit support,
      follow the instructions in $RDBASE/External/AvalonTool/README to
      get a copy of the Avalon toolkit source and put it in the
      appropriate place.

Setup and Preparation
---------------------

This section assumes that python is installed in ``c:\Python27``, that the
boost libraries have been installed to ``c:\boost``, and that
you will build the RDKit from a directory named ``c:\RDKit``. If any of
these conditions is not true, just change the corresponding paths.

  * If you install things in paths that have spaces in their names,
    be sure to use quotes properly in your environment variable
    definitions.

  * If you are planning on using a development version of the RDKit:
    get a copy of the current RDKit source using git. If you're
    using the command-line client the command is: ``git clone 
    https://github.com/rdkit/rdkit.git c:\RDKit``

  * If you are planning on using a released version of the RDKit : get
    a copy of the most recent release and extract it into the directory ``c:\RDKit`` 

  * Set the required environment variables (you can set this in cygwin
    or in windows. If you set them in windows, be sure to restart your
    cygwin window)

    * ``RDBASE = c:\RDKit`` 
    * Make sure ``c:\Python27`` is in your PATH
    * Make sure ``c:\RDKit\lib`` is in your PATH
    * Make sure ``c:\boost\lib`` is in your PATH.
    * Make sure ``c:\RDKit is`` in your PYTHONPATH

Building from the command line (recommended)
--------------------------------------------

  * Create a directory ``c:\RDKit\build`` and cd into it
  * Run cmake. Here's an example basic command line for 64bit windows that assumes the InChI and
    Avalon toolkit sources are available (see above):
    ``cmake -DRDK_BUILD_PYTHON_WRAPPERS=0N -DAVALONTOOLS_DIR=c:/avalontoolkit_beta/sourcedistribution -DBOOST_ROOT=c:/boost -DRDK_BUILD_INCHI_SUPPORT=ON -DRDK_BUILD_AVALON_SUPPORT=ON -G"Visual Studio 10 Win64" ..`` 
  * Build the code. Here's an example command line:
    ``c:/Windows/Microsoft.NET/Framework64/v4.0.30319/MSBuild.exe /m:4 /p:Configuration=Release INSTALL.vcxproj``

Building the Code Using GUIs (not recommended)
----------------------------------------------

  * Environment variables: if cmake complains about not being able to find it, define the environment variable BOOST_ROOT to point to the directory containing the boost source.
  * Configure the build:

    * Start the cmake gui
    * tell it where the source code is (e.g. c:/RDKit) and where to build the binaries (recommended: c:/RDKit/build)
    * click "Configure", select your compiler, and wait until the
      basic configuration is complete, you'll see a bunch of red entries in the main windows.
    * click "Configure" again
    * click "Generate"

  * Build:

    * open the solution file that cmake created (c:/RDKit/build/RDKit.sln) with Visual Studio.
    * check to be sure that you're building a Release build (for some reason CMake produces solution files that default to doing a Debug build)
    * build the "ALL_BUILD" target; this will take a while and generate warnings, but there should be no errors. Note: if you are building the SWIG wrappers you may get an error the first time you try to build them. If you see this error, try building ALL_BUILD again; it should work the second time.
    * build the "INSTALL" target

Testing the Build (optional, but recommended)
-------------------------------------------
  
  * cd to ``c:\RDKit\build`` and run ctest.
  * you're done!
