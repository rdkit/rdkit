<h2>Editing Molecules</h2>

In addition to adding new molecules from ChemDraw, it is also possible
to edit the molecules that are already in the results
tree.
To do so, right click on a molecule item and select <tt>Edit
Molecule</tt> from the context menu. The molecule will be displayed in
ChemDraw, where you can make the desired changes. Once you are done
editing, click <tt>Ok</tt> in the dialog box and your changes will be
brought into the results tree.  To abort the
editing, click <tt>Cancel</tt> in the dialog and the molecule will not
be modified.

<p>If you would like to edit a copy of the molecule (leaving the
original molecule unaltered in the results tree), right click on the
molecule item and select <tt>Duplicate Molecule</tt> from the context
menu. The copied molecule will be added at the top of the results
tree; the copy can be edited as described above.
