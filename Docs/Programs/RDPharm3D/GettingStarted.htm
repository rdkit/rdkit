<h2>Getting Started</h2>

Once you have launched the software, you need to load a P3D file
containing a pharmacophore definition and other parameters. 
This is done by selecting the <tt>File->Open</tt> menu option and
browsing to the file.

<p>Your computer may also be configured so that double clicking P3D files
will automatically launch the program; consult your IT staff for
information about this option.
