<h1>Introduction/Overview<br>
</h1>
<h2>Program Goals</h2>
RDPharm3D is a
computational tool that allows scientists who are not computational
experts to
quickly and
easily ask -- and answer -- "what if?" type questions using
pharmacophore
models.
The models themselves are developed by computational chemists and
deployed to the end-user scientists. End users query the pharmacophore
models by simply
drawing
probe molecules in ChemDraw and then pulling them into RDPharm3D with a
button
click.
