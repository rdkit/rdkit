// Notes:
//  1) don't include charges
//  2) The search for salts is a substructure search where the substructure
//     must match the entire fragment, so we don't need to be choosy about bond 
//     types
//  3) The matching is done in order, so if you put the more complex stuff at the
//     bottom the "don't remove the last fragment" algorithm has a chance of
//     of returning something sensible

// start with simple inorganics:
[Cl,Br,I]
[Li,Na,K,Ca,Mg]
[O,N]

// "complex" inorganics
[N](=O)(O)O
[P](=O)(O)(O)O
[P](F)(F)(F)(F)(F)F
[S](=O)(=O)(O)O
[CH3][S](=O)(=O)(O)
c1cc([CH3])ccc1[S](=O)(=O)(O)	p-Toluene sulfonate

// organics
[CH3]C(=O)O	  Acetic acid
FC(F)(F)C(=O)O	  TFA
OC(=O)C=CC(=O)O	  Fumarate/Maleate
OC(=O)C(=O)O	  Oxalate
OC(=O)C(O)C(O)C(=O)O	  Tartrate
C1CCCCC1[NH]C1CCCCC1	  Dicylcohexylammonium
