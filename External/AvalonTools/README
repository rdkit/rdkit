To use the Avalon Toolkit support in the RDKit, you need to download the source code separately.

If you already have a copy of the most recent version downloaded, run `cmake` with the 'AVALONTOOLS_DIR' set to the location of the `SourceDistribution` directory of the Avalon toolkit download.

If you are on a UNIX variant system (Linux, Mac OS X, Cygwin, etc), you may download a copy by invoking the included script `download-avalon.sh`:

	$ bash download-avalon.sh

This will grab everything you need and copy it to the right place.

Otherwise, first download a copy of the most recent version of the source code .tar file from:
https://sourceforge.net/projects/avalontoolkit/files/

Note that it's important to grab the most recent version.

Extract the tar file somewhere.
Create the directory $RDBASE/External/AvalonTools/distrib and copy the contents of the SourceDistribution directory there.
Confirm that the directory $RDBASE/External/AvalonTools/distrib/common exists.

Now rerun`cmake` with `-DRDK_BUILD_AVALON_SUPPORT=ON` as an additional argument
