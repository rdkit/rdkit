To build the optional InChI support, you have to download the official InChI
software distribution from the IUPAC website, and place the source code in this
directory. Please follow these instructions.

1. Download the zip file from
   http://www.inchi-trust.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/INCHI-1-API.zip

2. Unzip the package. 

3. In the unzipped folder, find INCHI-1-API/INCHI_API/inchi_dll, under which
   there are 73 files including things like ichi.h and ikey_dll.c. Copy all
   these 73 files to the empty directory 'src' residing inside the same
   directory that contains this README file you are reading. The actual path is
   '$RDKIT_SOURCE_TREE_ROOT/External/INCHI-API/src'.

4. Rerun `cmake` with `-DRDK_BUILD_INCHI_SUPPORT=ON` as an additional argument

Alternatively, if you are on a UNIX variant system (Linux, Mac OS X, Cygwin,
etc), you may invoke the included script `download-inchi.sh`:
	
	$ bash download-inchi.sh

When the download is successful, rerun`cmake` with
`-DRDK_BUILD_INCHI_SUPPORT=ON` as an additional argument
