AAreadme xpcw.txt
-----
It is part of A.D. Software's software engineering standards to
place an AAreadme.txt file in every directory of any importance.
If a file is missing it is to be considered a bug, unless the
directory is covered by a file in a parent directory.
-----
This directory contains CodeWarrior projects to build libs and test programs.

Note: as of 2004-03-15 the xpcw.pro8.mcp xpcwlibMachO project doesn't build,
for Mach-O projects in the past I've just included expat and expatpp source directly.
