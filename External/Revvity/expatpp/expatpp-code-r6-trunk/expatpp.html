The nesting approach was used in our OOFILE report-writer which saves report layout and data out to XML files and allows them to be read back into our preview window. The OOFILE source files oofriXML.cpp and oofriXML.h are included as a demonstration of how to use nested parsers and may be freely copied.		</p>		<p>			Note: the OOF_XMLrepLayoutParser was first developed by one of my programmers before the nesting parser concept and so uses a somewhat awkward state model. Start with OOF_XMLrepParser::startElement to see how the nested parsers are created.		</p>		<h2> 			<hr>			Build Notes</h2> 		<p>			The directory <samp>samp_pp</samp> contains testexpat.c which is a plain expat demo for CodeWarrior copied from elements.c and modified to open a specified file rather than stdin and a CharacterDataHandler added. It also contains testexpatpp.cpp which is a C++ equivalent using expatpp. It also contains oofriXML.* as a demonstration of how to use nested parsers.		</p>		<p>			The directory <samp>src_pp</samp> contains the XML parser object expatpp in two source files, built on top of the <samp>expat</samp> source. See the header file expatpp.h for instructions.		</p>		<p>			The directory <samp>xpcw</samp> contains <a href="http://www.metrowerks.com/">CodeWarrior</a> Pro4 &amp; Pro5 project to build a demo using testexpatpp.cpp. This project has been built with Apple's Universal Headers 3.2. Unlike earlier project stationery, the MacOS.lib file in the 68K target has been replaced with interface.o due to linker conflicts.		</p>		<p>			These projects expect the expat source directory to be added within the expatpp directory, ie:		</p><pre>expatpp   expat   expatpp.html   samp_pp   src_pp   xpcw   xpvc</pre> 		<p>			The directory vc_pp contains a Visual C++ v6 project to build static libraries for expatpp. Contributions for other targets gratefully accepted.		</p>		<p>			When you run the sample, entering a filename such as simpleTable.xml will cause that file to be parsed and the results displayed on the console.		</p>		<p>			&nbsp;		</p>		<address>			<a href="mailto:dent@oofile.com.au">Andy Dent</a>			<br>			Resident guru on too many damn platforms		</address>		<address>			<a href="http://www.oofile.com.au/">A.D.
