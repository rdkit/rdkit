Network Architecture:

A tacit assumption in all of this stuff is that we're dealing with
feedforward networks.

The network itself is stored as a list of NetNode objects.  The list
is ordered in the sense that nodes in earlier/later layers than a
given node are guaranteed to come before/after that node in the list.
This way we can easily generate the values of each node by moving
sequentially through the list, we're guaranteed that every input for a
node has already been filled in.

Each node stores a list (inputNodes) of indices of its inputs in the
main node list.
