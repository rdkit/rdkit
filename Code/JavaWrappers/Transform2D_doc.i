Constructor.
<p>
Initialize to an identity matrix transformation This is a 3x3 matrix that includes the rotation and translation parts see Foley's 'Introduction to Computer Graphics' for the representation
<p>
Operator *= and = are provided by the parent class square matrix. Operator *= needs some explanation, since the order matters. This transform gets set to the combination other and the current state of this transform If this_old and this_new are the states of this object before and after this function we have this_new(point) = this_old(other(point))
