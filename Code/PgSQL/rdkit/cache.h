/*
 * Cache subsystem. Molecules and fingerprints I/O is extremely expensive.
 *
 * This module provides support for caching the toasted data values that
 * functions receive as argument, together with their detoasted,
 * deserialized, or signature representations. This may help saving the time
 * that would be otherwise required to some queries to process the same
 * argument values multiple times (for example repeatedly unpickling the
 * same RDKit molecule).
 * 
 * This cache mechanism also provides the functions code with a high level
 * API that encapsulates the details of the conversion from the toasted
 * PostgreSQL Datum and the different representations of the supported
 * value types.
 * 
 * A cache instance is associated with a memory context where the
 * cached values are allocated, and it's therefore automatically cleared
 * when the same context is reset or destroyed. For this reason the client
 * code doesn't usually create/use this cache with the "current" memory
 * context, but rather with the longer-living context that is available
 * to the function as fcinfo->flinfo->fn_mcxt.
