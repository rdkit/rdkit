    see Foley's "Introduction to Computer Graphics" for the representation

    Operator *= and = are provided by the parent class square matrix.
    Operator *= needs some explanation, since the order matters. This transform
    gets set to
    the combination other and the current state of this transform
    If this_old and this_new are the states of this object before and after this
