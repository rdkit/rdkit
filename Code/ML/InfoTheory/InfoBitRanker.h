/*! \brief Class used to rank bits based on a specified measure of infomation
 *
 * Basically a primitive mimic of the CombiChem "signal" functionality
 * To use:
 *  - create an instance of this class
 *  - loop over the fingerprints in the dataset by calling accumulateVotes
 *method
 *  - call getTopN to get the top n ranked bits
 *
 * Sample usage and results from the python wrapper:
 * Here's a small set of vectors:
 * >>> for i,bv in enumerate(bvs): print bv.ToBitString(),acts[i]
 * ...
 * 0001 0
 * 0101 0
 * 0010 1
 * 1110 1
 *
 * Default ranker, using infogain:
 * >>> ranker = InfoBitRanker(4,2)
 * >>> for i,bv in enumerate(bvs): ranker.AccumulateVotes(bv,acts[i])
 * ...
 * >>> for bit,gain,n0,n1 in ranker.GetTopN(3): print
 *int(bit),'%.3f'%gain,int(n0),int(n1)
 * ...
 * 3 1.000 2 0
 * 2 1.000 0 2
 * 0 0.311 0 1
 *
 * Using the biased infogain:
 * >>> ranker = InfoBitRanker(4,2,InfoTheory.InfoType.BIASENTROPY)
 * >>> ranker.SetBiasList((1,))
 * >>> for i,bv in enumerate(bvs): ranker.AccumulateVotes(bv,acts[i])
 * ...
 * >>> for bit,gain,n0,n1 in ranker.GetTopN(3): print
 *int(bit),'%.3f'%gain,int(n0),int(n1)
 * ...
 * 2 1.000 0 2
 * 0 0.311 0 1
 * 1 0.000 1 1
 *
 * A chi squared ranker is also available:
 * >>> ranker = InfoBitRanker(4,2,InfoTheory.InfoType.CHISQUARE)
 * >>> for i,bv in enumerate(bvs): ranker.AccumulateVotes(bv,acts[i])
 * ...
 * >>> for bit,gain,n0,n1 in ranker.GetTopN(3): print
 *int(bit),'%.3f'%gain,int(n0),int(n1)
 * ...
 * 3 4.000 2 0
 * 2 4.000 0 2
 * 0 1.333 0 1
 *
 * As is a biased chi squared:
 * >>> ranker = InfoBitRanker(4,2,InfoTheory.InfoType.BIASCHISQUARE)
 * >>> ranker.SetBiasList((1,))
 * >>> for i,bv in enumerate(bvs): ranker.AccumulateVotes(bv,acts[i])
 * ...
 * >>> for bit,gain,n0,n1 in ranker.GetTopN(3): print
 *int(bit),'%.3f'%gain,int(n0),int(n1)
 * ...
 * 2 4.000 0 2
 * 0 1.333 0 1
 * 1 0.000 1 1
