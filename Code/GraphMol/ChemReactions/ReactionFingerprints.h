//! A struct for storing parameters to manipulate

/*!
   Different parameters can be chosen to influence the generation
   of chemical reaction fingerprints. Generally different setting
   should be used for structural or difference fingerprints.

   \param includeAgents        include the agents of a reaction for fingerprint
   generation
   \param bitRatioAgents       in structural fingerprints it determines the
   ratio of bits of
                               the agents in the fingerprint
   \param nonAgentWeight       in difference fingerprints weight factor for
   reactants and products
                               compared to agents
   \param agentWeight          if agents are included, agents could be weighted
   compared to reactants
                               and products in difference fingerprints
   \param fpSize               number of bits of the fingerprint
   \param fpType               kind of fingerprint used, e.g AtompairFP. Be
   aware that only AtompairFP,
                               TopologicalTorsion and MorganFP were supported in
   the difference fingerprint.
