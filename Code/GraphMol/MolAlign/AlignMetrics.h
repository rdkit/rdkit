  Returns the RMS between two conformations.

  of the molecule (i.e. the reference) before RMS calculation and,
  as a side-effect, will be left in the aligned state.

  \param confId2    the id of the second conformer

                    to all atoms)
  \param prealigned by default the conformers are assumed to be unaligned and
                    will therefore be aligned to the first conformer

  Returns the optimal RMS for aligning two molecules, taking

  left in the aligned state.

  \param refMol       the reference molecule
  \param prbMol       the molecule to be aligned to the reference

  Note:
  This function will attempt to align all permutations of matching atom
  orders in both molecules, for some molecules it will lead to 'combinatorial
  explosion' especially if hydrogens are present.
  Use 'rdkit.Chem.AllChem.AlignMol' to align molecules without changing the
  atom order.
