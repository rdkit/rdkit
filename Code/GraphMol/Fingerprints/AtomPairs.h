  A few quick notes about fingerprint size and the way chirality is handled in
  these functions.

  By default the atom-pair and topologic-torsion fingerprints do not include any
  information about
  chirality; the atom invariants only include information about the atomic
  number,
  number of pi electrons, and degree.
  When chirality is included, two additional bits are added to the atom
  invariants to flag R/S/no
  chirality. These additional bits change the size of the atom invariants and
  either the size
  of the final fingerprint (atom pairs) or the maximum allowed path length
  (torsions). This means
  that even fingerprints for achiral molecules are different when
  includeChirality is true.
