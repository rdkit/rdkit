//! \brief Compute the 2D coordinates such the interatom distances
//   mimic those in a distance matrix
/*!

  This function generates 2D coordinates such that the inter-atom
  distances mimic those specified via dmat. This is done by randomly
  sampling(flipping) the rotatable bonds in the molecule and
  evaluating a cost function which contains two components. The
  first component is the sum of inverse of the squared inter-atom
  distances, this helps in spreading the atoms far from each
  other. The second component is the sum of squares of the
  difference in distance between those in dmat and the generated
  structure.  The user can adjust the relative importance of the two
  components via a adjustable paramter (see below)

  ARGUMENTS:

  \param mol - molecule to generate coordinates for

  \param dmat - the distance matrix we want to mimic, this is a
  symmetric N by N matrix where N is the number of atoms in mol. All
  negative entries in dmat are ignored.

  \param canonOrient - canonicalize the orientation after the 2D
  embedding is done

  \param clearConfs - clear any previously existing conformations on
  mol before adding a conformation

  \param weightDistMat - A value between 0.0 and 1.0, this
  determines the importance of mimicing the the inter atoms
  distances in dmat. (1.0 - weightDistMat) is the weight associated
  to spreading out the structure (density) in the cost function

  \param nFlipsPerSample - the number of rotatable bonds that are
  flipped at random for each sample

  \param nSamples - the number of samples

  \param sampleSeed - seed for the random sampling process

  \param permuteDeg4Nodes - try permuting the drawing order of bonds around
        atoms with four neighbors in order to improve the depiction

  \return ID of the conformation added to the molecule cotaining the
  2D coordinates

/*!
  This function generates a depiction for a molecule where a piece of the
  molecule is constrained to have the same coordinates as a reference.

  This is useful for, for example, generating depictions of SAR data
  sets so that the cores of the molecules are all oriented the same way.

  ARGUMENTS:

                  with a single conformer.
  \param reference -    a molecule with the reference atoms to align to;
                        this should have a depiction.
  \param confId -       (optional) the id of the reference conformation to use
  \param referencePattern -  (optional) a query molecule to be used to
                             generate the atom mapping between the molecule
                             and the reference.

  \param refPattern - (optional) a query molecule to map a subset of
                      the reference onto the mol, so that only some of the
                      atoms are aligned.
