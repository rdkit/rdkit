//! Set upper and lower distance bounds between atoms in a molecule based on

/*!
  This consists of setting 1-2, 1-3 and 1-4 distance based on bond lengths,
  bond angles and torsion angle ranges. Optionally 1-5 bounds can also be set,
  in particular, for path that contain rigid 1-4 paths.

  The final step involves setting lower bound to the sum of the vdW radii for
  the remaining atom pairs.

  \param mol          The molecule of interest
  \param mmat         Bounds matrix to the bounds are written
  \param set15bounds  If true try to set 1-5 bounds also based on topology
  \param scaleVDW     If true scale the sum of the vdW radii while setting lower
  bounds
                      so that a smaller value (0.7*(vdw1 + vdw2) ) is used for
  paths
                      that are less five bonds apart.

  <b>Note</b>
  For some strained systems the bounds matrix resulting from setting 1-5 bounds
  may
  fail triangle smoothing. In these cases it is recommended to back out and
  recompute the bounds matrix with no 1-5 bounds and with vdW scaling.
