//! Parameter object for controlling embedding
/*!
  numConfs       Number of conformations to be generated

  numThreads     Sets the number of threads to use (more than one thread
                 will only be used if the RDKit was build with multithread
                 support) If set to zero, the max supported by the system will
                 be used.

  maxIterations  Max. number of times the embedding will be tried if
                 coordinates are not obtained successfully. The default
                 value is 10x the number of atoms.

  randomSeed     provides a seed for the random number generator (so that
                 the same coordinates can be obtained for a
                 molecule on multiple runs) If -1, the
                 RNG will not be seeded.

  clearConfs     Clear all existing conformations on the molecule

  useRandomCoords  Start the embedding from random coordinates instead of
                   using eigenvalues of the distance matrix.

  boxSizeMult    Determines the size of the box that is used for
                 random coordinates. If this is a positive number, the
                 side length will equal the largest element of the distance
                 matrix times \c boxSizeMult. If this is a negative number,
                 the side length will equal \c -boxSizeMult (i.e. independent
                 of the elements of the distance matrix).

  randNegEig     Picks coordinates at random when a embedding process produces
                 negative eigenvalues

  numZeroFail    Fail embedding if we find this many or more zero eigenvalues
                 (within a tolerance)

  pruneRmsThresh Retain only the conformations out of 'numConfs' after
                 embedding that are at least this far apart from each other.
                 RMSD is computed on the heavy atoms.
                 Prunining is greedy; i.e. the first embedded conformation is
                 retained and from then on only those that are at least
                 \c pruneRmsThresh away from already
                 retained conformations are kept. The pruning is done
                 after embedding and bounds violation minimization.
                 No pruning by default.

  coordMap       a map of int to Point3D, between atom IDs and their locations
                 their locations.  If this container is provided, the
                 coordinates are used to set distance constraints on the
                 embedding. The resulting conformer(s) should have distances
                 between the specified atoms that reproduce those between the
                 points in \c coordMap. Because the embedding produces a
                 molecule in an arbitrary reference frame, an alignment step
                 is required to actually reproduce the provided coordinates.

  optimizerForceTol set the tolerance on forces in the DGeom optimizer
                    (this shouldn't normally be altered in client code).

  ignoreSmoothingFailures  try to embed the molecule even if triangle bounds
                           smoothing fails

  enforceChirality  enforce the correct chirality if chiral centers are present

  useExpTorsionAnglePrefs  impose experimental torsion-angle preferences

  useBasicKnowledge  impose "basic knowledge" terms such as flat
                     aromatic rings, ketones, etc.

  ETversion      version of the experimental torsion-angle preferences

  verbose        print output of experimental torsion-angle preferences

  basinThresh    set the basin threshold for the DGeom force field,
                 (this shouldn't normally be altered in client code).

  onlyHeavyAtomsForRMS  only use the heavy atoms when doing RMS filtering
