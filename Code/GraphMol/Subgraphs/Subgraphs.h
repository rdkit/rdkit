   \brief functionality for finding subgraphs and paths in molecules

   Difference between _subgraphs_ and _paths_ :
      Subgraphs are potentially branched, whereas paths (in our
      terminology at least) cannot be.  So, the following graph:
\verbatim
            C--0--C--1--C--3--C
                  |
                  2
                  |
                  C
\endverbatim
      has 3 _subgraphs_ of length 3: (0,1,2),(0,1,3),(2,1,3)
      but only 2 _paths_ of length 3: (0,1,3),(2,1,3)
