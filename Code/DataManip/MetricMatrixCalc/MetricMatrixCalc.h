 *  Examples of the container include PySequenceHolder which is wrapper around
 *  a python sequence objects like lists and tuples.
 *  Examples of the entryType include a sequence of double, floats, and
 *ExplicitBitVects

   *  descrips - vectType container with a entryType for each item
   *  nItems - the number of item in the descripts.
   *           In several cases this argument is irrelvant since vectType

   *           a size() member function, But we would like this interface to
   *take for example
   *           a double** and correctly parse the row and columns.
   *  dim - the dimension of the sequences
   *  distMat - pointer to an array to write the distance matrix to
   *            it is assumed that the right sized array has already be
   *allocated.
   *
   * FIX: we can probably make this function create the correct sized distMat
   *and return
   * it to the caller, but when pushing he result out to a python array not sure
   *how to
   * avoid copy the entire distance matrix in that case
   *

   *
   *  pointer to a 1D array of doubles. Only the lower triangle elements are
   *  included in the array
