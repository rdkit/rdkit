//! A class to store forcefields and handle minimization
/*!
   A force field is used like this (schematically):

   \verbatim
     ForceField ff;

     // add contributions:
     for contrib in contribs:
       ff.contribs().push_back(contrib);

     // set up the points:
     for positionPtr in positions:
       ff.positions().push_back(point);

     // initialize:
     ff.initialize()

     // and minimize:
     needsMore = ff.minimize();

   \endverbatim

   <b>Notes:</b>
     - The ForceField owns its contributions, which are stored using smart
       pointers.
     - Distance calculations are currently lazy; the full distance matrix is
       never generated.  In systems where the distance matrix is not sparse,
       this is almost certainly inefficient.
